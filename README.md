# MyHaven-Smart-Plug
Script for monitoring Bill ($) &amp; Kilowatt-Hour Consumption for Smart Plug device

- Designed an idea for a real-time web security dashboard that displays a 3D rendering of a campus showing the location, status, and analytics of all smart-devices. 
- Developed a Python script that fetches monthly and real-time (Smart Plug) data from MyPlace API, calculates monthly and current bill/kilowatt-hour consumption, and feeds data to web security dashboard.

# Update
As of now, the project can run on its own. Several debugging print statements have been added in ```Main.py``` to track which part of the script has just ran. To run the script, download all files onto a folder, access the folder directory and type ```python Main.py``` from the command line. Hope you enjoy :)
